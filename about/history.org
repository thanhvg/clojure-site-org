The [[https://hopl4.sigplan.org/track/hopl-4-papers#History-of-HOPL][History of Programming Languages conference series]] produces accurate
historical records and descriptions of programming language design, development,
and philosophy. It is infrequently held: the first three were in 1978, 1993,
and 2007.

2020 is the time for [[https://hopl4.sigplan.org][HOPL-IV]], and I'm very excited and honored to have a paper
on Clojure be [[https://dl.acm.org/toc/pacmpl/2020/4/HOPL][accepted]]. I want to thank Guy Steele and Richard Gabriel,
co-chairs of HOPL IV, as well as the reviewers and shepherds for their support
and guidance. Clojure is not the product of traditional research and (as may be
evident) writing a paper for this setting was a different and challenging
exercise. I hope the paper provides some insight into why Clojure is the way it
is and the process and people behind its creation and development.
